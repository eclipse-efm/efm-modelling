<ul>
<li>the "GraphViz" action that launches the graph visualization tool on a ".gv" graph file that is selected on the "Project Explorer"</li>
<li>the "Run SEW" action that launches the symbolic execution defined on a ".favm" precompiled SEW file that is selected on the "Project Explorer"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>if a ".gv" graph file is selected on the "Project Explorer", this will launch the graph visualization tool</li>
<li>if a ".favm" precompiled SEW file is selected on the "Project Explorer", this will launch the corresponding symbolic execution</li>
</ul>
