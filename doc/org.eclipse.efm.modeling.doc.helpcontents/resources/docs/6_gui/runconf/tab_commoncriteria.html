<p>In "Graph size limits" :</p>
<ul>
<li>"Nodes" gives the maximal number of nodes of the symbolic execution tree (when it is -1 there is no limit)</li>
<li>"Width" gives the maximal width of the symbolic execution tree (when it is -1 there is no limit)</li>
<li>"Height" gives the maximal height of the symbolic execution tree (when it is -1 there is no limit)</li>
</ul>

<p>In "Evaluation limits" :</p>
<ul>
<li>"Evaluation Steps" gives the maximal number of steps of calculus during the symbolic execution (when it is -1 there is no limit)</li>
<li>"Timeout" gives the maximal duration of the symbolic execution (when it is -1 there is no limit)</li>
</ul>

<p>In "Analyze Strategy", the user can choose the algorithm that is used for the creation of the tree :</p>
<ul>
<li>"BFS" is Breadth First Search</li>
<li>"DFS" is Depth First Search</li>
<li>"RFS" is Random First Search</li>
</ul>
