<h2>The Dispenser</h2>

<p>In the same fashion, we define the Dispenser automaton. We also added a new output port : "monitor_level" which retransmits the current level of water at each transition.</p>

<p>There are other keywords and concepts in XLIA such as clocks, timed guard ... but we won't discuss those in this present tutorial.</p>

<h2>Communications between automata</h2>

<p>One last thing is left to do : connecting the ports we have defined earlier. To do that, in the same level as the "@machine:" annotation of the beginning, we will list our communications declarations after a "@com:" annotation (see picture)</p>
<p>To distinguish between two kinds of communications, we'll use two different flags to declare them :</p>
<ul>
<li>the "env" flag connects the given ports to the symbolic execution engine which will provide random input data</li>
<li>the "rdv" flag links two existing ports of different automata : one input port and one output port. The data of the input port will be transmitted to the output port.</li>
</ul>
