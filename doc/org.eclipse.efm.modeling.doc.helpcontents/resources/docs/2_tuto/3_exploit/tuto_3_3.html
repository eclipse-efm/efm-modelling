<h1>Transition Coverage</h1>

<p>Another feature of the symbolic engine is "Transition Coverage". Its goal is to find a set of paths/traces (as short as possible) in which all the existing transitions are triggered (at least) once.</p>

<p>Combined with the evaluation of numeric values that would allow those paths to be taken, this feature can help the user to produce tests for his/her system.</p>

<p>In what follows, we will apply this feature on our tutorial example.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Firstly, we select "Transition Coverage" in "Run Configurations..." :</p>

<p>We verify that the numerical values will be produced on the "Test Generation" tab :</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>When running the engine, we obtain a tree that covers all transitions and that is as short as possible :</p>

<p>By comparing the tree, and the text file containing the numeric values, we can deduce the data that is required to go through this tree :</p>

<p>We see that for a level of 4, we need 3 pumping cycles to reach LVLRECO :</p>
<p>On one hand :</p>
<p>lvl + FLOW*T &le; LVLRECO</p>
<p> 4  +   2 *T &le;   10   </p>
<p>Therefore : T &le; 3</p>
<p>On the other hand :</p>
<p>lvl + FLOW*(T+1) &gt; LVLRECO</p>
<p> 4  +   2 *(T+1) &gt;   10   </p>
<p>Therefore : T &lt; 2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As T=3 is the lowest number of pumping cycles that can be done (seen <a href="tuto_3_2.html#general">previously</a>), we have indeed the shortest tree possible.</p>
