<h1>"@property" section</h1>


<p>To define machine behavior, we traditionally use data that belongs and is local to the machine in addition to the possibly existing parameters. This owned data must be declared in the "@property" section.</p>
<p>Properties can belong to any kind of higher level machines such as the <a href="../1_3_machtype_1_system.html">system</a> or <a href="../1_3_machtype_2_stmach.html">state-machines</a>.</p>


<h2>Visibility</h2>

<p>Each element declared in the "@property" section is associated to a visibility "modifier" which can be "public" or "private" and which is "private" by default.</p>
<p>To be accessed by other elements of the model i.e. for public data, the modifier must be explicitly set to "public".</p>

<p>Below is an example showing how to use the "@property" section to declare elements (we'll see just afterwards what kinds of elements can be added). To state the visibility, we can use the keywords "public" or "private".</p>

<h2>A variant using visibility-specific sections</h2>

<p>To simplify the writing when declaring several properties that share the same visibility modifier, we can also use the "<a href="dico_public.html">@public</a>" and "<a href="dico_private.html">@private</a>" sections in which a default visibility is enforced.</p>
<p>Please refer to the corresponding documentation in the sections dictionary.</p>



<h2>Nature of the properties</h2>
<p>Those properties can be :</p>
<ul>
<li>variables of a primitive type</li>
<li>variables of a structured or enumerated types (arrays, collection, queues ...)</li>
<li>custom types (the property is a type that can then be used to declare variables of this type)</li>
<li>variables that are typed, constants, clocks...</li>
<li>interactions points, called "ports"</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend consulting the documentation about <a href="../2_properties/2_0_properties.html">properties</a> for further details.</p>
