<h1>Fiddling with a statemachine's "@irun{...}"</h1> 


<h2>Example Application</h2>
<p>Let's go back to back to the <a href="actprim_irun_1_1.html">video game example</a> of before that was used to showcase the "@irun{...}" of basic states.</p>
<p>We can factorize the "@irun{...}" of the states "level_1" and "level_2" into a single "@irun{...}" in the parent "myGameProgression" statemachine as in the following code :</p>

<p>We notice that, unlike for states, the "@irun{...}" activity primitive of statemachines needs to be within an "<a href="../sectiondico/dico_moe.html">@moe:</a>" section.</p>
<p>Which gives the following graph :</p>

<p>As a consequence, at each given step of evaluation, the player, starting from a given level, gets a new "currentScore" through the port "obtained_score" and can either stay in the same level or go to the next according to the score value :</p>
