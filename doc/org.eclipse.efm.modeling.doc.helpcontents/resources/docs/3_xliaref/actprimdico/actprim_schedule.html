<h1>"@schedule{...}" activity primitive</h1>

<p>The "@schedule{...}" and "<a href="actprim_concurrency.html">@concurrency{...}</a>" primitives are syntactic sugar to describe the scheduling of a machineâ€™s executable components.</p>

<p>The "@schedule{...}" primitive may contain the evaluation politics of some (or all) the subcomponents of the parent machine.</p>
<p>The link between policies described with the "@schedule{...}" and "<a href="actprim_concurrency.html">@concurrency{...}</a>" primitives is the <a href="../5_ordop/ordop_10.html">weak sequence</a> "|;;|"</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>For example, suppose we have a machine M containing four executable components A, B, C and D, with primitives :</p>
<ul>
<li>@schedule{ |,| run A ; run C ; }</li>
<li>@concurrency{ |;;| }</li>
</ul>

<p>Its implicit scheduling policy, triggered by primitive "@run{...}", will be :</p>
<ul>
<li>{ |;;|  { |,| run A ; run C ; }  { |;;| run B ; run D ; } }</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is equivalent, by transitivity of operator "|;;|", to :</p>
<ul>
<li>{ |;;|  { |,| run A ; run C ; }  run B ; run D ; }</li>
</ul>
