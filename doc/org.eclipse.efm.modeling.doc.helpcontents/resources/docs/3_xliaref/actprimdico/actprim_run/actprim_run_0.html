<h1>"@run{...}" activity primitive</h1>

<p>The "@run{...}" may gather instructions concerning what to evaluate next (with for starting point the parent machine).</p>
<p>It may also gather other instructions, in a fashion similar to the "<a href="../actprim_irun/actprim_irun_0.html">@irun{...}</a>" activity primitive. However, there are differences notably :</p>
<ul>
<li>the order of execution is not exactly the same</li>
<li>the effects of the "@irun{...}" evaluation are preserved even if the evaluation of the "@run{...}" fails</li>
</ul>


<p>Different uses of the "@run{...}" activity primitive :</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="actprim_run_3.html">"@run{...}" in Systems</a></li>
<li>the <a href="actprim_run_2.html">"@run{...}" in StateMachines</a></li>
<li>the <a href="actprim_run_1.html">"@run{...}" in States</a></li>
</ul>



<p>See the <a href="../../4_examples/4_inefficientproject.html">Inefficient Project Workflow</a> example, which makes use of the "@run{...}" activity primitive.</p>
