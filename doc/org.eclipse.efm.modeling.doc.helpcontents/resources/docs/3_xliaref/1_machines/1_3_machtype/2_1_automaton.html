<h1>Statemachine as automata</h1>

<h2>Definition and declaration</h2>
<p>This kind of statemachine models simple automata. The submachines of an automaton are machines of type <a href="3_state.html">state</a>.</p>
<p>Those "state" objects are declared within the "@region:" section :</p>

<h2>Model of Computation</h2>
<p>An automaton may have several states but they being active is controlled. Therefore, the statemachine is declared with a "<a href="../1_4_moc.html">moc</a>" either "or" or "xor".</p>

<p>Difference between "or" and "xor" :</p>
<ul>
<li>"moc: or", one or several states can be active simultaneously</li>
<li>"moc : xor", one and only one state can be active simultaneously (we recommend that all automata be modeled as "xor" statemachines which is the only formally correct model)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='init'>Initial state</h2>
<p>Initializing an "automaton" statemachine requires to specify which one is/are its starting states. Indeed, the engine needs to know at which state the machine must be at the beginning of the simulation</p>

<p>There are two ways of doing so in XLIA. Those two ways use "<a href="3_state.html#flags">state flags</a>".</p>

<h3>Example case</h3>
<p>For explaining purposes, we'll use a very simple example. Let's suppose we have a statemachine A with two possible states during execution : A1 and A2.</p>
<p>Le'ts suppose we want A to begin at the state A1.</p>

<h3>The UML-compliant method</h3>
<p>With this method, we must add a third state to the state-machine A. This state is an unstable "source-state" that will be immediately left at the beginning of the simulation.</p>

<p>To do that, we define an "initialstate" by using the flag "initial". We fit this "initialstate" with a transition to the "A1" state.</p>

<p>By following this method, we will end up with the following code and state-machine :</p>

<p>Remarks :</p>
<ul>
<li>We strongly recommend using this method over the next one, as it reproduces the standard UML design.</li>
<li>This is the UML-compliant method because like for most graphical modeling languages, in UML, initial states are fundamentally different from other states.</li>
<li>The advantage of this method is that we can do initialization operations (such as setting variable values...) at the beginning by completing the "<a href="../../4_instructions/4_1_block.html">instruction block</a>" of the "startup" transition.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<h3>The Quick method</h3>
<p>With this method there is no need to have a third state. We just add the flag "start" to the "A1" state so that the "A" state-machine will go to this state at the beginning of the simulation.</p>

<p>Remarks :</p>
<ul>
<li>The "start" state is an syntactic shortcut for both the only initial state and the simple state in which the statemachine will be after its initialization, i.e. after the evaluation of its initial transition.</li>
</ul>
