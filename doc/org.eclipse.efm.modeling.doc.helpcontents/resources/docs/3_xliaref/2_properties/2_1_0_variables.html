<h1>Variables</h1>


<p>Variables are objects that represent a type and a value. For instance the couple (INTEGER,2) which informs us that we face an integer of value 2, is a variable.</p>

<p>In XLIA, a variable must belong to a parent machine. Machines use variables to keep track of things, to compute things...</p>

<h2>General Variable Declaration</h2>
<p>Every variable used in a machine must be previously declared, and it can be initialized with an expression. The general syntax is the following (see <a href="../0_bnf_syntax.html">BNF syntax</a>) :</p>

<p>Where, in order of apparition :</p>
<ul>
<li>"modifier" can be one, none (depending on declaration context), or any sequence of the following keywords :
	<ul>
	<li>"public"</li>
	<li>"private"</li>
	<li>"static"</li>
	<li>"final"</li>
	<li>"macro"</li>
	<li>"volatile"</li>
	<li>"unsafe"</li>
	<li>"transient"</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>"var" is the mandatory non-modifiable keyword to declare variables (highlighted in the editor)</li>
<li>"aTypeID" is a string that matches a property type name known by the machine (see <a href="3_3_types.html">types</a>)</li>
<li>"aVariableID" is the name you want the variable to have</li>
<li>"[=initial_value]" is an optional way of initializing the variable with a hard value either by:
	<ul>
	<li>writing a hard-coded value</li>
	<li>writing an expression between brackets that can include more complex operations with other known variables</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>"( ; | {rw_action})" means that we can either :
	<ul>
	<li>put a ";" sign and end the declaration</li>
	<li>specify a set of behaviors linked to this variable between the brackets. Those behaviors can for instance be actions that are triggered when Diversity rewrite the value of the variable (hence "rw_action")</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This general presentation will be extended and given more detail with examples in the following.</p>

<h2>Variables Modifiers</h2>

<h2>Initial Value</h2>
<p>Initial values of variables can be given, either with raw values, or by evaluating an expression at the beginning of the simulation. For instance :</p>
