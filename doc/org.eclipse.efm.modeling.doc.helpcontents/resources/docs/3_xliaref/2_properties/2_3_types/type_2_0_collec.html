<h1>Collection Types</h1>
<p>We can create types which are collections of other types (either primitive or custom). For instance a list of integer or a queue of strings...</p>
<p>In a more formal speech, a collection is a container for items of a given type.</p>
<p>An optional maximal size can be given with a positive integer (use "*" sign for infinite (anyway it is the default value)).</p>
<p>There are different kinds of collections. Each one can be declared with its own keyword. The syntax is the following :</p>

<p>Remarks :</p>
<ul>
<li>"aTypeID" is the alias of the type of elements that will be contained within the collection</li>
<li>what's between square brackets is optional : this is to specify the maximum number of elements that the collection can hold</li>
<li>we'll see concrete implementations in the following sub sections</li>
</ul>
