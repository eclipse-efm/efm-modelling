<p>In the following example, we define a statemachine that receives structured objects and that analyze and forward their contents. In the code, we can see that we can access elements of the structure through their name with : "structurename.elementname".</p>

<p>The textual trace of a symbolic exploration ascertain the correspondence between the input phoneaction and the forwarded output :</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>In the following example, we'll see how to initialize values for "struct" type variables and how to modify such a variable.</p>
<p>The code in the following (see comments for syntax) :</p>

<p>As expected, we get the following trace :</p>
