<h1>Ports</h1>
<p>An interaction point (called "port" in XLIA), enables data transmission during communication operations :</p>
<ul>
<li>A port is given a name.</li>
<li>A port's communication operations can be unilateral i.e. one-way (input or output), or bilateral i.e. two-way (inout).</li>
<li>A port can carry any one or several types of data. Every data type going through a port must be specified</li>
<li>A port can be associated with an expression to be sent by default, such as a macro, which is evaluated before transmission.</li>
<li>A port can be associated, by default, with the left part of an assignment, which will be evaluated during the reception operation, and used to store the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Port Declaration</h2>
<p>Every interaction port used in a machine must be previously declared and defined. The general syntax is the following (see <a href="../0_bnf_syntax.html">BNF syntax</a>) :</p>

<p>Where, in order of apparition :</p>
<ul>
<li>the "modifier" which is always public defines the visibility of the object</li>
<li>the "port_io" defines whether or not we can use this port to do specific tasks :
	<ul>
	<li>with "input" ports we can for instance trigger a transition or import a value for a local variable from something that is outside the parent machine</li>
	<li>with "output" ports, we can for instance convey a local value to what's outside the parent machine</li>
	<li>with "inout" ports we can do both</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>in the "params" section, we can list the types of objects the port carries. We can furthermore specify some behaviors when the port handles those values</li>
</ul>
