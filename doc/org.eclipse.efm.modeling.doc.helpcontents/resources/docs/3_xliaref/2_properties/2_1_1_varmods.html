<h1>Variables Modifiers</h1>

<p>Variable modifiers can add some variants to the definition of a variable. Those variations are mainly about how the execution engine deals with the variable.</p>

<h2>MODIFIER : "public" and "private"</h2>
<p>Please refer to the "<a href="dico/dico_property.html">@property</a>" section.</p>

<h2>MODIFIER : "final"</h2>

<p>The "final" modifier turns the variable into a constant which is a sub-type of variable.</p>
<p>A constant is a variable which can be initialized but never modified. It can never be the left member of an assignment nor be used for data reception.</p>
<p>We can also replace "final var" by the syntactic shortcut "const" :</p>

<h2 id="macro">MODIFIER : "macro"</h2>
<p>A macro is a typed "variable-function" that can be used as any variable of the same type. When it is used, it must always have a value, which is a function of other variables, so that it can be evaluated as a function. For example:</p>

<p>We can also replace "macro var" by the syntactic shortcut "macro" :</p>

<h4>Disambiguation</h4>
<p>See also "<a href="dico/dico_macro.html">@macro</a>" section to avoid confusion between those two different things.</p>



<h2>MODIFIER : "volatile"</h2>
<p>This attribute indicates that the value of a public variable can be modified outside its normal visibility scope, for example by a parallel machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>




<h2 id="unsafe">MODIFIER : "unsafe"</h2>
<p>This information is used by the XLIA compiler: if the variable is of a ranged type, the compiler will check all its uses and possibly generate a monitor to put constraints on expressions which are assigned to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>




<h2>MODIFIER : "transient"</h2>
<p>This attribute indicates that a variable can only be used in computations, and never as a state variable of the machine. This information is used by heuristics such as those which try to anticipate redundant symbolic evaluations.</p>
