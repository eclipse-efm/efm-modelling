<h1>The "|;;|" order operator : weak sequence</h1>
<p>This is not a standard sequence: its evaluation terminates if one of the two processes P or Q terminate. We try to evaluate P. If it terminates, then Q is evaluated from the resulting context, otherwise, from the initial context. This sequence can be used to create a partial order which avoids combinatorial explosion resulting from machine interleaving.</p>
<p>Considering 2 processes : P and Q, with weak sequence :</p>
<ul>
<li>we execute first P then Q in the context resulting from execution of P</li>
<li>if P fails we execute Q from the initial context</li>
<li>if Q fails we execute P from the initial context</li>
</ul>


<h2>Application on the most basic example</h2>

<p>And exploring the different paths with the symbolic engine (3, 4 and 5 evaluation steps) gives us (here the execution is simultaneous because nothing prevents it from doing so) :</p>
