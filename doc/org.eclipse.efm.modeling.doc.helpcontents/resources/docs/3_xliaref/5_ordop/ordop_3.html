<h1>The "|or|" order operator : weak synchronism</h1>

<p>Considering 2 processes : P and Q, with weak synchronism, both processes are evaluated :</p>
<ul>
<li>either simultaneously (everywhere where possible)</li>
<li>in an exclusive way in all other cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Be warned about the risk of combinatorial explosion on the number of paths.</p>


<h2>Application on the most basic example</h2>
<p>Applying this on our <a href="../../4_examples/1_mostbasic.html" shape="rect">most basic example</a>, the "@moe:" section looks like :</p>

<p>And exploring the different paths with the symbolic engine (3, 4 and 5 evaluation steps) gives us (here the execution is simultaneous because nothing prevents it from doing so) :</p>
