<h1>The "|i|" order operator : interlacing (default scheduling)</h1>
<p>Both processes are sequentially evaluated, considering every possibility: here P followed by Q and Q followed by P. Warning: this operator easily leads to an explosion of the number of execution paths.</p>
<p>Considering 2 processes : P and Q, with interlacing, both process are evaluated sequentially while preserving the exhaustivity of the possible cases. It means at each iteration (i.e. from each context), Diversity will explore both :</p>
<ul>
<li>the context resulting from the symbolic execution of P then Q</li>
<li>the context resulting from the symbolic execution of Q then P</li>
</ul>
<p>This method can entail combinatorial explosion on the number of execution paths.</p>
