<h1>BNF syntax</h1>

<p>On several occasions in this documentation, we'll be using a formalism to explain XLIA syntax and grammar. This formalism is inspired by the BNF i.e. Backus-Naur Form.</p>
<p>Symbols for the grammar meta-language are in orange : </p>
<ul>
<li>brackets [ ] surround optional elements,</li>
<li>+ means that the preceding expression (possibly between parentheses) can be repeated one or several times,</li>
<li>* that it can be repeated any number of times (including none)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Terminal symbols i.e. language keywords, are in red, and non-terminals in green.</p>

<p>In black are variable names and standard non-terminals (e.g. statement, expression) that will not be recalled in this document.</p>
