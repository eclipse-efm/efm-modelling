<h1>"@parameter:" section</h1>


<p>When instantiated, a machine can receive parameters, that is data denoted by variables. These parameters must be declared in the "@parameter:" section.</p>

<p>When creating machines of the "prototype" <a href="../1_machines/1_1_design.html">design</a>, this section behaves the same way as the "<a href="dico_property.html">@property:</a>" section.</p>
<p>However, the difference with the "<a href="dico_property.html">@property:</a>" section can be revealed when using the model-instance paradigm, as we can <a href="../1_machines/1_1_design.html#specparam">specify each instance parameter</a> when creating a new instance from a given model.</p>

<p>Concretely, the "@parameter:" section most often gathers declaration of <a href="../2_properties/2_1_0_variables.html">variables</a>.</p>
