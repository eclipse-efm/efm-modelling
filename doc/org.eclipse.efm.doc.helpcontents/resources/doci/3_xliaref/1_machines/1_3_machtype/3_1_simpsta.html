<h1>State as basic state</h1>
<p>This kind of state is the most simple. We must not define any sub-state within its body and the parent state-machine can have this state as its current state at any evaluation step.</p>
<p>What's most important about simple states are the transitions. Transitions define the relationships between this state and the other states of the same parent statemachine (or parent composite state).</p>
<p>To define a <a href="../../3_transitions/3_0_transitions.html">transition</a> within a given state body, we must give it a name and a target (indicated by the characters "-->"). In the following example, we can see possible syntaxes :</p>
