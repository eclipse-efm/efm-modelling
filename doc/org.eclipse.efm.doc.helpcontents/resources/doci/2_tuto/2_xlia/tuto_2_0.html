<h1 id="XLIA">Modeling with XLIA</h1>

<p>XLIA is a modeling language. Its names stands for eXecutable Language for Interaction & Assemblage. In the (very limited) scope of this tutorial, we will use this language to build a model of the Water System. We will then be able to use this model to confirm our expectations concerning the behavior of the system.</p>

<p>No new information will be added; we will only use the model we have defined previously (2 automata: 4 attributes, 3 ports, 3 states & 2 attributes, 2 ports, 2 states).</p>

<p>In this tutorial, what we will mainly do with XLIA is to declare lists of objects. Object declaration usually works in blocks between brackets as you'll see.</p>
<p>In a <a href="tuto_2_1.html" shape="rect">first part</a>, we will introduce basic XLIA syntax principles while building the "Pump" state-machine.</p>
<p>In a <a href="tuto_2_2.html" shape="rect">second part</a>, we will quickly present the equivalent for the "Dispenser" state-machine, as well as explaining how communication between the two machines are defined in XLIA.</p>
