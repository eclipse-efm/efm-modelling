	<h1>EFM Project Analysis Modes</h1>

	<p>In this documentation, we will present three analysis proposed by EFM Project to users.</p>
	
	<p>For each project, you can open these three analysis modes by a simple right mouse click on the project and following instruction "Run as => Run Configurations". After, you need to create a new configuration from your Symbolic Execution Workflow always by a right mouse click (Symbolic Execution Workflow => New). In the sub-menu Main, in Analysis Profile, you can find easily the Exploration, the Transition Coverage and the Behavior Selection mode. We explain clearly the operation for each analysis mode in next sessions</p>
