<h1>"@moe:" section</h1>

<p>The "@moe:" section is a section used to implement <a href="../actprimdico/actprim_0.html">activity primitives</a>.</p>

<p>Concretely, it provides the possibility to directly implement the behavior of "machines" via  basic primitives (init, run, enable, disable, ...) that are a priori automatically generated post-compilation (for instance, in the case of "state-machines").</p>
<p>When in the "system" machine, it can be used to schedule the launch of the different statemachines.</p>
