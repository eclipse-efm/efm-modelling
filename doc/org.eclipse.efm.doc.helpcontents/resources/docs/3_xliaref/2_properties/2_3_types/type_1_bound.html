<h1>Bounded numbers and Intervals</h1>
<p>We can create sub-types of numerical primitive types that implements boundary conditions on the value of the variable. There are two ways of doing so.</p>

<h2>Bit-wise boundaries</h2>
<p>By default, calculations on numbers are performed with arbitrary precision (according to "gnu/gmp" i.e. GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library). But it is possible to give limits to types by defining an interval thanks to powers of two :</p>
<ul>
<li>[0 , 2<sup>N</sup>] for unsigned types</li>
<li>[-2<sup>N-1</sup> , 2<sup>N-1</sup>-1] for signed types</li>
</ul>
<p>The concrete syntax is the following :</p>

<h2>Intervals</h2>
<p>Less symmetrical intervals can be defined via the "interval" type. This is the "anIntervalTypeDefinition" we've seen above. Intervals are defined upon a "support", which must be a primitive numerical type.</p>
<p>The standard ISO notation will be used to tell if the interval is open or closed, i.e. if its limits are included or not :</p>
<ul>
<li>left  : open "]",  closed "["</li>
<li>right : open "[",  closed "]"Â»</li>
</ul>
<p>To define a numerical variable which value is bounded to a certain interval, use the following syntax :</p>
