<h1>Machine type : system</h1>

<p>In a XLIA file, the main "machine" is called "system".</p>
<p>When it is a composite machine, it is still possible to specify the nature of concurrency between its components as a machine. By default, when no precisions are given, a composite "system" will be considered as being of type "or" (see <a href="../1_4_moc.html">moc</a>).</p>

<h2>Declaring the system</h2>
<p>To declare a "system", we use the keyword "system" :</p>

<h2>Body of the system</h2>
<p>Systems and what they do is mainly defined by their sub-components. As for all machines, we list system sub-components in sections introduced by a "@XXX:" keyword. Those sections gather the declarations of all sub-components of a given type.</p>

<p>For the "system" type of machine, the most important sections to know about are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally speaking :
	<ul>
	<li>any section in which we can define objects of type "var", "port" and "type" as attributes of the system such as "@property:"</li>
	<li>the "<a href="../../sectiondico/dico_machine.html">@machine:</a>" section, in which we list all the "statemachine" submachines which corresponds to the automata that interact within the system</li>
	<li>the "<a href="../../sectiondico/dico_com.html">@com:</a>" section, in which we describe the interactions between machines or between machines and the system environment</li>
	<li></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>In use with the <a href="../1_1_design.html">model-instance paradigm</a> :
	<ul>
	<li>the "<a href="../../sectiondico/dico_instance.html">@instance:</a>" section, in which we create all the instances of "statemachine" objects from our "statemachine" models</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
