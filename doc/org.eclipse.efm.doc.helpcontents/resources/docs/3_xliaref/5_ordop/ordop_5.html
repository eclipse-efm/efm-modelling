<h1>The "|>|" order operator : priority</h1>
<p>Process P is evaluated in the initial context. Process Q is evaluated in the initial context with in addition, if P terminates, the Boolean negation of conditions resulting from P's evaluation. Thus, if both P and Q terminate, there are two possible resulting contexts.</p>
<p>Considering 2 processes : P and Q, when assuming the priority P |>| Q :</p>
<p>Q is evaluated in the initial context</p>
<ul>
<li>if P succeeds, Q is not evaluated</li>
<li>if P fails, Q is evaluated in the initial context, negating the eventual consequences of the failed symbolic execution of P</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application on the most basic example</h2>
<p>Applying this on our <a href="../../4_examples/1_mostbasic.html">most basic example</a>, the "@moe:" section looks like :</p>

<p>Here the transitions concerning the automaton "A" will be prioritized over the ones concerning the automaton "B"</p>
<p>WARNING : as you can see, this scheduling operator is not a reflexive binary operator : "P |>| Q" is not the same thing as "Q |>| P".</p>
<p>And exploring the different paths with the symbolic engine (3, 4 and 5 evaluation steps) gives us (here the execution is simultaneous) :</p>
