<h1>The "|;|" order operator : strong sequence</h1>
<p>Its evaluation terminates only if both P and Q terminate. Otherwise, no effects are preserved, and we go back to the initial context.</p>
<p>Considering 2 processes : P and Q, with strong sequence we execute first P and then Q (non-reflexive operation):</p>
<ul>
<li>if either P or Q fails no results are kept : the context remains the same</li>
<li>if P and Q succeed : the context integrates the effects of both transitions</li>
</ul>


<h2>Application on the most basic example</h2>

<p>And exploring the different paths with the symbolic engine (3, 4 and 5 evaluation steps) gives us (here, as all transitions cannot do anything else than succeeding, each step integrates the effect of both the automata's transitions simultaneously) :</p>
