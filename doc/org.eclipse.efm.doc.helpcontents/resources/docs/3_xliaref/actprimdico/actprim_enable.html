<h1>"@enable{...}" activity primitive</h1> 

<h2>Generalities</h2>
<p>The "@enable{...}" activity primitive corresponds to the activity of a UML statemachine entering a state.</p>
<p>It can only have a "state" for parent. It is evaluated when activating any state.</p>

<p>The evaluation of a transition will follow this pattern :</p>
<ul>
<li>source state deactivation</li>
<li>action evaluation</li>
<li>and then target state activation (which is what is done within the "@enable{...}" activity primitive)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Below is an example of the syntax in use :</p>

<img src="images/enabledisable001.png" width=800, border="3">
<p>Here, if during the execution, the machine goes from state :</p>
<ul>
<li> s1 to s2, will be triggered in order :
	<ul>
	<li>actions inside the "@disable" of state s1</li>
	<li>actions for the transition s1TOs2</li>
	<li>actions inside the "@enable" of state s2</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> s1 to s3, will be triggered in order :
	<ul>
	<li>actions inside the "@disable" of state s1</li>
	<li>actions for the transition s1TOs3</li>
	<li>nothing else because state s3 doesn't have an "@enable" action primitive</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Other scheduling possibilities will be available in further XLIA versions.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that <a href="../../4_examples/2_robotpetsimple.html">The Simple Robot Pet</a> example makes use of the "@enable{...}" activity primitive.</p>
